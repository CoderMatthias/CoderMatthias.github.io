subtitle: Data analyist, with bioinformatics leanings
---

My name is Matt.  I work as a bioinformaticist, but am overall more broadly interested in analyzing large data sets and automating all the time consuming jobs currently being done.

Important facts about my computation education before you judge my coding ability:
- I didn't have a computer in the house until I was 10.
- I didn't have the internet until I was 14, and that was only dial-up.
- I didn't pursue anything computational in my undergrad.
- I got my PhD in a strictly molecular, at-the-bench lab setting.

Hopefully that will explain a bit.
